I manage to overcome 2 things with same solution:

1.  the game i coded is ending if original checkmate occur. that's mean that only if no one
    can protect the king, the game ended. i did it by checking if no move is legal, and if no
    move is legal and the king is in check, the game ending.
2.  the program can handle satlemate case (some kind of tie). again, checking if no move is
    legal. if so, and if the player not in check, then the game is over with satelmate.

hope to get bonus for both solutions, even though they've solved at once.
